Below are the requirements for both basic (G) and advanced (VG) testing within the scope of your project.

## Basic Requirements (G-requirements)

For the basic requirements, you only need to document how unit tests could be implemented in your project. Answer the following questions directly in this text file:

- Based on the structure of your project, what would you need to do to enable unit testing in your project? (For example, what design patterns have you implemented or would need to implement to enable testing?)
  - ANSWER: **(your answer here)**
- Provide examples of two unit tests that could be implemented in your project.
  - Test Case 1: Describe what is being tested and why: **(your answer here)**
  - Expected result (what the test is expected to confirm): **(your answer here)**
  - Test Case 2: Describe what is being tested and why: **(your answer here)**
  - Expected result (what the test is expected to confirm): **(your answer here)**
